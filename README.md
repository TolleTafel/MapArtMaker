# MapArtMaker
A python tool for creating realistic looking Minecraft Map Art from a reference image. Just run the script, select a reference image and finally select where the datapack gets saved to.
To place the Map Art in game just place the generated Datapack in the world folder and run /function map_art:place

The main.py file and colors.json files have to be in the same folder!
