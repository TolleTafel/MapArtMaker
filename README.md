# MapArtMaker
A python tool for creating realistic looking Minecraft Map Art from a reference image. 
1. Run the script
2. Select a reference image
3. Select where the datapack gets saved to
The tool takes the resolution of the reference image and translates every pixel to a block.
To place the Map Art in game just place the generated Datapack in the world folder and run /function map_art:place

The main.py file and colors.json files have to be in the same folder!
